#You can declare a varible by giving it a name and then an equal sign next to it to assign a value
name = "Ark"
age = 13
goal = "Cybersecurity and AI"

#You can print a varibles value by simply using the print satement and then putting your varible name into the brackets without quotation marks
print("My name is", name)
print("I am", age, "years old right now when I have made this")
print("My goal is to work in", goal)

#You can also change varibles
Age = age + 1
print("Next year I will be", Age, "years old")

#Python is a case sensitive language, it will take Age and age as 2 different varibles becuase it has different character cases
